# Introduction & Architecture

Welcome to the NVIDIA DPF on OpenShift documentationâ€”your technical resource for deploying, managing, and optimizing NVIDIA BlueField DPUs and DOCA services in Red Hat OpenShift environments.

---

## What is DPF?

- **DPF:** DOCA Platform Framework
- **Purpose:** Integrates NVIDIA BlueField DPUs with OpenShift to deliver advanced networking, security, and acceleration for enterprise Kubernetes workloads.
- **Scope:** Automates the full lifecycle:
    - Cluster creation
    - DPU provisioning
    - DPF Operator deployment
    - DOCA service deployment
    - Advanced operations and troubleshooting

---

## Who Should Use This Guide?
- **Platform Engineers:** Build and operate OpenShift clusters with DPU acceleration
- **DevOps Teams:** Automate DPU/DOCA lifecycle and cluster management
- **Solution Architects:** Design scalable, secure, and high-performance OpenShift environments
- **Advanced Administrators:** Customize, tune, and troubleshoot DPF/DOCA deployments

---

## Why Integrate DPF with OpenShift?

- **Accelerated Networking & Security**
    - Offload and isolate critical functions to DPUs
    - Improve performance and security for sensitive workloads

- **Automated Lifecycle Management**
    - End-to-end automation for deployment, upgrades, and scaling
    - Reduce manual effort and operational risk

- **Flexible Integration Paths**
    - Greenfield (new cluster), brownfield (existing cluster), and service-focused scenarios

- **Enterprise-Grade Reliability**
    - Built on Red Hat and NVIDIA best practices

### Main Components
- **OpenShift Control Plane:** Manages cluster state, scheduling, and orchestration
- **Worker Nodes:** Run application workloads and interface with DPUs
- **NVIDIA BlueField DPUs:** Provide hardware acceleration for networking, security, and storage
- **DPF Operator:** Automates DPU provisioning, configuration, and lifecycle management
- **DOCA Services:** Deployable workloads leveraging DPU capabilities (e.g., accelerated networking, security services)

### How It Works
- The DPF Operator provisions and configures DPUs across the cluster
- DOCA services are deployed to leverage DPU resources for enhanced performance and security
- Automation scripts and manifests ensure repeatable, validated deployments

## Documentation Approach

- **Modular & Scenario-Based**
    - Start from any point: new deployment, existing cluster, or service-focused path

- **Progressive Disclosure**
    - High-level overviews with links to detailed, step-by-step guides

- **Visual Navigation**
    - Architecture diagrams, workflow charts, and decision trees guide users through complex scenarios
