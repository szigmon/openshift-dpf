# OVN Injector Webhook Blocking MCE Installation - Root Cause Analysis & Fix

## üîç Problem Summary

**Issue**: MCE (MultiCluster Engine) operator installation consistently fails with "bundle unpacking failed. Reason: DeadlineExceeded" even on clean clusters.

**Root Cause**: The OVN resource injector webhook intercepts **ALL** pod creation operations, including OLM (Operator Lifecycle Manager) bundle unpacking jobs, preventing MCE installation.

## üß† Technical Analysis

### Why MCE Bundle Unpacking Failed

1. **OVN Injector Webhook**: The `ovn-kubernetes-resource-injector` deploys a **mutating admission webhook** that intercepts pod creation
2. **OLM Bundle Unpacking**: MCE installation requires OLM to create Jobs that unpack operator bundles
3. **Webhook Interference**: The OVN injector webhook blocks or delays these Jobs, causing bundle unpacking timeouts
4. **No InstallPlan Creation**: Without successful bundle unpacking, OLM never creates the InstallPlan for MCE

### Evidence

- **Clean cluster testing**: Same issue occurred even without HyperShift components
- **No OLM jobs**: `oc get jobs -n openshift-operator-lifecycle-manager | grep multicluster` returned empty
- **Subscription stuck**: MCE subscription existed but never progressed beyond `BundleUnpacking` status
- **Webhook presence**: OVN injector deployment and webhook configurations were active

## üîß Complete Solution

### Immediate Fix Script

Run the comprehensive fix script:
```bash
./fix-mce-installation.sh
```

This script will:
1. ‚úÖ Remove OVN injector webhook and all components
2. ‚úÖ Clean up failed MCE subscription  
3. ‚úÖ Install MCE operator successfully
4. ‚úÖ Create MCE instance with HyperShift enabled
5. ‚úÖ Verify installation completion

### Manual Fix Steps

If you prefer manual steps:

1. **Disable OVN Injector**:
   ```bash
   make disable-ovn-injector
   ```

2. **Clean Failed MCE Subscription**:
   ```bash
   oc delete subscription multicluster-engine -n multicluster-engine
   ```

3. **Wait for Webhook Cleanup**:
   ```bash
   sleep 15  # Allow webhook changes to propagate
   ```

4. **Install MCE**:
   ```bash
   oc apply -f manifests/cluster-installation/mce-operator.yaml
   ```

5. **Monitor Installation**:
   ```bash
   oc get csv -n multicluster-engine -w
   ```

6. **Create MCE Instance**:
   ```bash
   oc apply -f mce-next-steps.yaml
   ```

## üöÄ Updated Automation Flow

### New Default Behavior

- **`make all`**: Deploys cluster and DPF **WITHOUT** OVN injector (prevents OLM conflicts)
- **`make all-with-injector`**: Full deployment including OVN injector (use only after operators are installed)

### Deployment Sequence

1. **Phase 1 - Core Deployment**: `make all`
   - ‚úÖ Cluster creation
   - ‚úÖ DPF operator installation  
   - ‚úÖ MCE installation (no webhook interference)
   - ‚úÖ All operators working

2. **Phase 2 - Enable OVN Injector**: `make enable-ovn-injector`
   - ‚úÖ Deploy OVN injector webhook
   - ‚úÖ Enable advanced networking features
   - ‚úÖ Create NetworkAttachmentDefinitions

### New Makefile Targets

- `make disable-ovn-injector`: Remove OVN injector and all components
- `make enable-ovn-injector`: Deploy OVN injector (only after operators are installed)
- `make all`: Main deployment WITHOUT injector
- `make all-with-injector`: Full deployment WITH injector

## üìã Verification Commands

### Check MCE Installation
```bash
# MCE operator status
oc get csv -n multicluster-engine

# MCE instance status  
oc get mce multiclusterengine -o wide

# MCE pods
oc get pods -n multicluster-engine

# HyperShift pods (if enabled)
oc get pods -n hypershift
```

### Check OVN Injector Status
```bash
# Injector deployment (should be empty after fix)
oc get deployment -n ovn-kubernetes ovn-kubernetes-resource-injector

# Webhooks (should be empty after fix)
oc get mutatingadmissionwebhooks | grep -i ovn

# NetworkAttachmentDefinition (should be empty after fix)
oc get net-attach-def -n ovn-kubernetes dpf-ovn-kubernetes
```

## üîÑ When to Re-enable OVN Injector

**Safe to re-enable AFTER**:
- ‚úÖ MCE operator installed and running
- ‚úÖ All required operators deployed
- ‚úÖ HostedCluster creation tested
- ‚úÖ No pending OLM operations

**Command to re-enable**:
```bash
make enable-ovn-injector
```

## üéØ Key Learnings

1. **Admission webhooks can block OLM operations**: Any webhook that intercepts pod creation can prevent operator bundle unpacking
2. **Clean cluster doesn't guarantee success**: System-level components (like webhooks) can still cause issues
3. **Order matters**: Deploy operators BEFORE webhooks that might interfere with them
4. **OVN injector timing**: Should be deployed AFTER all operators are installed and working

## üìö Files Created/Modified

### New Scripts
- `scripts/disable-ovn-injector.sh`: Comprehensive OVN injector removal
- `fix-mce-installation.sh`: Complete fix automation script

### Modified Files
- `Makefile`: Updated targets to avoid injector by default
- `OVN-INJECTOR-MCE-ISSUE.md`: This documentation

### Configuration Files

## üèÜ Success Criteria

‚úÖ **MCE operator installs successfully without timeouts**
‚úÖ **HyperShift components deploy automatically via MCE**  
‚úÖ **OLM operations work without webhook interference**
‚úÖ **HostedCluster creation works with declarative manifests**
‚úÖ **OVN injector can be re-enabled safely after operator deployment**
